<p>I  graduated from a double degree program from Wilfrid Laurier University in Business (BBA) and Computer Science (BSc). Over the 5-year program, I specialized in finance, machine learning and data management and analytics.</p>

<p>I work as a consultant at KPMG in the Deal Advisory team. I leverage my business and technology skillset to improve the way infrastructure is delivered and help communities grow. My work has included building 5G network strategies with public sector clients, data management and developing operational dashboards, and building financial models for acquisitions of infrastructure assets.
